#What is this?
This project takes power data collected from each circuit in a house, and provides a way to explore that data, stored in a database backend. Histograms provide an overall picture of the distribution of power consumption on all circuits and allow for highlighting of matching aggregated events. The power level of each individual circuit can also be viewed through a bar graph and brushing through the view at the bottom of the screen.

#Future Work
*Providing the capability to identify appliances that are running on individual circuits.
*Find and highlight correlations between circuits
*Select a specific pattern on any number of circuits, distinguished by characteristics of sustained power usage and time between events, etc. and find and highlight other patterns that match
*Provide an aggregated view of all circuits

#Note
This was originally hosted in red hat's OpenShift Cloud, so parts of the code are specific to that environment.
